	<h1>Our Story</h1>
	<p>
	Splinter Sellers was started with the idea of making the lives of students across Australia easier.
	<br>
	</br>
	Having been students ourselves we knew that there was a huge amount of students that had trouble both affording new
	textbooks and many of us had a great deal of almost new textbooks that we no longer used.
	<br>
	</br>
	As such we began Splinter Sellers,
	We now sell a vast range of already unwrapped textbooks at below industry standard prices.
	<br>
	</br>
	Our online only storefront not only allows us to offer our customers the best prices possible,
	but also makes the process of procuring textbooks for the new semester as fast and stress free as can be.
	<br>
	</br>
	While we pride ourselves on only re-selling the best already-unwrapped textbooks available, this leaves many of our acquisitions unsuited to our standards.
	<br>
	</br>
	Rather than simply disposing of inappropriate stock, we make a point to ensure that every textbook that passes through our hands is received by a student in need;
	we donate all unsold product to local charities.
